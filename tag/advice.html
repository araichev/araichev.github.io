      <h1><a href="https://raichev.net/regrets-of-the-dying.html">Regrets of the Dying</a></h1>
      <p>This post from Bronnie Ware, reposted from <a class="reference external" href="https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/">her website</a>, i keep in the back of my mind.
I find regret 5 the most subtle.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>For many years I worked in palliative care. My patients were those who had gone home to die. Some incredibly special times were shared. I was with them for the last three to twelve weeks of their lives.</p>
<p>People grow a lot when they are faced with their own mortality. I learnt never to underestimate someone’s capacity for growth. Some changes were phenomenal. Each experienced a variety of emotions, as expected, denial, fear, anger, remorse, more denial and eventually acceptance. Every single patient found their peace before they departed though, every one of them.</p>
<p>When questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do differently, common themes surfaced again and again. Here are the most common five:</p>
<div class="section" id="i-wish-id-had-the-courage-to-live-a-life-true-to-myself-not-the-life-others-expected-of-me">
<h2>1. I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me</h2>
<p>This was the most common regret of all. When people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled. Most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made, or not made.</p>
<p>It is very important to try and honour at least some of your dreams along the way. From the moment that you lose your health, it is too late. Health brings a freedom very few realise, until they no longer have it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-wish-i-hadnt-worked-so-hard">
<h2>2. I wish I hadn’t worked so hard</h2>
<p>This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children’s youth and their partner’s companionship. Women also spoke of this regret. But as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.</p>
<p>By simplifying your lifestyle and making conscious choices along the way, it is possible to not need the income that you think you do. And by creating more space in your life, you become happier and more open to new opportunities, ones more suited to your new lifestyle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-wish-id-had-the-courage-to-express-my-feelings">
<h2>3. I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings</h2>
<p>Many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others. As a result, they settled for a mediocre existence and never became who they were truly capable of becoming. Many developed illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result.</p>
<p>We cannot control the reactions of others. However, although people may initially react when you change the way you are by speaking honestly, in the end it raises the relationship to a whole new and healthier level. Either that or it releases the unhealthy relationship from your life. Either way, you win.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-wish-i-had-stayed-in-touch-with-my-friends">
<h2>4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends</h2>
<p>Often they would not truly realise the full benefits of old friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down. Many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the years. There were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved. Everyone misses their friends when they are dying.</p>
<p>It is common for anyone in a busy lifestyle to let friendships slip. But when you are faced with your approaching death, the physical details of life fall away. People do want to get their financial affairs in order if possible. But it is not money or status that holds the true importance for them. They want to get things in order more for the benefit of those they love. Usually though, they are too ill and weary to ever manage this task. It all comes down to love and relationships in the end. That is all that remains in the final weeks, love and relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-wish-that-i-had-let-myself-be-happier">
<h2>5. I wish that I had let myself be happier</h2>
<p>This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice. They had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits. The so-called ‘comfort’ of familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their physical lives. Fear of change had them pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were content. When deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again.</p>
<p>When you are on your deathbed, what others think of you is a long way from your mind. How wonderful to be able to let go and smile again, long before you are dying.</p>
<p>Life is a choice. It is YOUR life. Choose consciously, choose wisely, choose honestly. Choose happiness.</p>

      <h1><a href="https://raichev.net/poor-charlies-almanack.html">Poor Charlie's Almanack</a></h1>
      <p>I recently read <em>Poor Charlie's Almanack</em>, a collection of the wit and wisdom of investor Charles Munger.
The book's content is summarized tolerably well in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger">Munger's Wikipedia biography</a> and the following free resources.</p>
<div class="section" id="munger-s-investment-checklist">
<h2>Munger's investment checklist</h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Measure risk. All investment evaluations should begin by measuring risk, especially reputational.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Incorporate an appropriate margin of safety</li>
<li>Avoid dealing with people of questionable character</li>
<li>Insist upon proper compensation for risk assumed</li>
<li>Always beware of inflation and interest rate exposures</li>
<li>Avoid big mistakes and shun permanent capital loss</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Be independent. Only in fairy tales are emperors told they're naked.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Objectivity and rationality require independence of thought</li>
<li>Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn't make you right or wrong. The only thing that matters is the correctness of your analysis and judgment.</li>
<li>Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Prepare ahead. The only way to win is to work, work, work, and hope to have a few insights.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading. Cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day.</li>
<li>More important than the will to win is the will to prepare</li>
<li>Develop fluency in mental models from the major academic disciplines</li>
<li>If you want to get smart, the question you have to keep asking is &quot;Why, why, why?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Have intellectual humility. Acknowledging what you don't know is the dawning of wisdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Stay within a well-defined circle of competence</li>
<li>Identify and reconcile disconfirming evidence</li>
<li>Resist the craving for false precision, false certainties, etc.</li>
<li>Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Analyze rigorously. Use effective checklists to minimize errors and omissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Determine value apart from price, progress apart from activity, and wealth apart from size</li>
<li>It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric</li>
<li>Be a business analyst, not a market, macroeconomic, or security analyst</li>
<li>Consider totality of risk and effect. Look always at potential second order and higher level impacts.</li>
<li>Think forwards and backwards. Invert, always invert.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Allocate assets wisely. Proper allocation of capital is an investor's number one job.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remember that highest and best use is always measured by the next best use (opportunity cost)</li>
<li>Good ideas are rare. When the odds are greatly in your favor, bet (allocate) heavily</li>
<li>Don't fall in love with an investment. Be situation-dependent and opportunity-driven.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Have patience. Resist the natural human bias to act.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world&quot; (Einstein). Never interrupt it unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary transactional taxes and frictional costs. Never take action for its own sake.</li>
<li>Be alert for the arrival of luck</li>
<li>Enjoy the process along with the proceeds, because the process is where you live</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Be decisive. When proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful</li>
<li>Opportunity doesn't come often, so seize it when it comes</li>
<li>Opportunity meeting the prepared mind. That's the game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Be ready for change. Live with change and accept unremovable complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you. Don't expect it to adapt to you</li>
<li>Continually challenge and willingly amend your best-loved ideas</li>
<li>Recognize reality even when you don't like it, especially when you don't like it</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Stay focused. Keep it simple and remember what you set out to do.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets and can be lost in a heartbeat</li>
<li>Guard against the effects of hubris and boredom</li>
<li>Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae</li>
<li>Be careful to exclude unneeded information or slop. &quot;A small leak can sink a great ship&quot; (Benjamin Franklin)</li>
<li>Face your big troubles. Don't sweep them under the rug.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Munger talk: A lesson on elementary, worldly wisdom as it relates to investment management and business</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://raichev.net/files/munger_talk_elementary_worldly_wisdom.txt">Transcript here</a>.</p>
<p>In this talk Munger introduces his latticework of mental models for worldly wisdom and recommends that you build your own.
He describes several of his models, including compound interest and the basics of algebra, combinatorics, probability, statistics, accounting, microeconomics, and psychology.
He doesn't enumerate all his models in this talk or in the rest of the almanack or on the internet, as far as i know.
But you can get more ideas from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/">Farnam Street's list of mental models</a>, which is inspired by Munger.</p>
<p>Update 2018-01-26: Here is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defmacro.org/2016/12/22/models.html">another collection of mental models</a> assembled by Slava Akhmechet.</p>

<p>In this talk Munger lists 25 human psychological tendencies (cognitive biases), some of their problems, and some of their antidotes.
Hint: Add these tendencies to your latticework of mental models and use them in checklist mode to avoid disasters in judgement.</p>
<p>Below is an audio recording from an earlier version of the talk (circa 1995), in case you want to hear Munger's voice.</p>

      <h1><a href="https://raichev.net/lessons-learned-from-a-bicycle-accident.html">Lessons Learned from a Bicycle Accident</a></h1>
      <p>Last week i wiped out on my usual bicycle ride home from work.
Nothing hospital-serious, but i did sustain three <a class="reference external" href="https://raichev.net/files/wipe_out_20170222_day_after.jpg">nasty abrasions (gory photo)</a> on my arm and leg, red badges of negligence as i will explain.</p>
<p>During my recovery i learned several important lessons that i pass on here as advice in hopes that it may help you and my future self.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">If you want to take tight turns on a bicycle, check that the tires have enough air, e.g. have pressures within the suggested ranges printed on the sidewalls.  Through carelessness i let my front tire deflate so much that it collapsed on a tight turn, pulling the bike out from under me and throwing me to the ground.  Additionally, if you want to corner at high speeds, you should <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bikeblogordie.com/2016/10/cornering-lessons-limits-of-grip.html">look through the turn, brake before entering, lean the bike in a separate phase, and exit with speed and confidence</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you have an abrasion, burn, or laceration, practice moist wound care to speed up healing, reduce pain, and reduce scarring compared to other wound care practices. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wound-treatment.jp/english/index_e.htm">More details from a hospital unit in Japan that practices the method</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Moist wound care can be cheap and natural, according to various traditional practices, case studies, and clinical trials i read about on the internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To clean the wound, you can use clean water with a pinch of salt. Avoid strong antiseptics, such as iodine or hydrogen peroxide, because they are toxic to all cells, including the ones needed for healing.</li>
<li>To help prevent infection and keep the wound moist, you can apply virgin coconut oil to the wound topically several times a day, or maybe some other traditional ointments, such as turmeric paste, aloe vera, or honey. I found many historical and anectdotal reports and a little clinical research suggesting that these ointments help. For the first 48 hours of treatment, i applied UMF 15+ manuka honey to my wound, but after near continuous intense burning and little sleep, i stopped. The pain disappeared immediately and never returned. A few days later and for the rest of my treatment i used coconut oil. In the future i will avoid strongly antibacterial honeys.</li>
<li>To further keep the wound moist and protect it from dirt and scratches, you can use banana leaves or potato skins held fast to the wound with cloth bandages and secured by a clip. Be sure to sterilize the leaves or skins by boiling them for at least 20 minutes or steaming them in a pressure cooker for at least 15 minutes. You can also sterilize the cloth wrap by the same methods and then dry it out in the oven or sun; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMB68-f5wGI">video instructions here</a>.  While you are hunting for banana leaves or potato skins, you can wrap the wound with plastic cling film, which is sterile and non-adherent. I would not use plastic wrap as a long-term solution, though, lest the plastic leech some toxic chemicals into the wound.  I used banana leaves foraged from trees in my neighborhood and vouch for their merciful non-adherence. <a class="reference external" href="https://signsurgeons.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/17.-Unsay-Joshua-Utilization-of-Banana-Leaf-Dressing-in-Wound-Healing.pdf">Here is some research on banana leaf dressing</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Take internal medicine while healing. Zinc (from food or supplements) for boosting the immune system, vitamin C (from food or supplements) to help your body make new skin, and anti-inflamatories, such as fresh turmeric and ginger infusion, in case your immune response gets out of hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Look out for signs of infection: extreme wound swelling, extreme pain, swollen lymph nodes, fever. The treatment above will help your immune system battle infection, but if it appears to be losing after the first few days of care, then you might need to enlist the help of strong antibiotics.  In that case, seek trained medical assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>

  <p><b>Why no comments?</b>
  I used to do public comments but found that moderating and maintaining them took too much time in front of the computer, time better spent playing outdoors.
  So these days I only do private comments, that is, you can email me comments regarding a post by clicking the 'Comment' link at the bottom of the post.
