<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Everywhere was theirs because they thought so.</div>
<div class="line">They with two leaves they whom the birds despise.</div>

<div class="line">They with two leaves they whom the birds despise.</div>
<div class="line">In the middle of stones they made up their minds.</div>
<div class="line">They started to cut.</div>
<div class="line">Well they cut everything because why not.</div>
<div class="line">Everything was theirs because they thought so.</div>
<div class="line">It fell into its shadows and they took both away.</div>
<div class="line">Some to have some for burning.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Well cutting everything they came to water.</div>
<div class="line">They came to the end of the day there was one left standing.</div>
<div class="line">They would cut it tomorrow they went away.</div>
<div class="line">The night gathered in the last branches.</div>
<div class="line">The shadow of the night gathered in the shadow on the water.</div>
<div class="line">The night and the shadow put on the same head.</div>
<div class="line">And it said Now.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Well in the morning they cut the last one.</div>
<div class="line">Like the others the last one fell into its shadow.</div>
<div class="line">It fell into its shadow on the water.</div>
<div class="line">They took it away its shadow stayed on the water.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Well they shrugged they started trying to get the shadow away.</div>
<div class="line">They cut right to the ground the shadow stayed whole.</div>
<div class="line">They laid boards on it the shadow came out on top.</div>
<div class="line">They shone lights on it the shadow got blacker and clearer.</div>
<div class="line">They exploded the water the shadow rocked.</div>
<div class="line">They built a huge fire on the roots.</div>
<div class="line">They sent up black smoke between the shadow and the sun.</div>
<div class="line">The new shadow flowed without changing the old one.</div>
<div class="line">They shrugged they went away to get stones.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">They came back the shadow was growing.</div>
<div class="line">They started setting up stones it was growing.</div>
<div class="line">They looked the other way it went on growing.</div>
<div class="line">They decided they would make a stone out of it.</div>
<div class="line">They took stones to the water they poured them into the shadow.</div>
<div class="line">They poured them in they poured them in the stones vanished.</div>
<div class="line">The shadow was not filled it went on growing.</div>
<div class="line">That was one day.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The next day was just the same it went on growing.</div>
<div class="line">They did all the same things it was just the same.</div>
<div class="line">They decided to take its water from under it.</div>
<div class="line">They took away water they took it away the water went down.</div>
<div class="line">The shadow stayed where it was before.</div>
<div class="line">It went on growing it grew onto the land.</div>
<div class="line">They started to scrape the shadow with machines.</div>
<div class="line">When it touched the machines it stayed on them.</div>
<div class="line">They started to beat the shadow with sticks.</div>
<div class="line">Where it touched the sticks it stayed on them.</div>
<div class="line">They started to beat the shadow with hands.</div>
<div class="line">Where it touched the hands it stayed on them.</div>
<div class="line">That was another day.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Well the next day started about the same it went on growing.</div>
<div class="line">They pushed lights into the shadow.</div>
<div class="line">Where the shadow got onto them they went out.</div>
<div class="line">They began to stomp on the edge it got their feet.</div>
<div class="line">And when it got their feet they fell down.</div>
<div class="line">It got into eyes the eyes went blind.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The ones that fell down it grew over and they vanished.</div>
<div class="line">The ones that went blind and walked into it vanished.</div>
<div class="line">The ones that could see and stood still</div>
<div class="line">It swallowed their shadows.</div>
<div class="line">Then it swallowed them too and they vanished.</div>
<div class="line">Well the others ran.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The ones that were left went away to live if it would let them.</div>
<div class="line">They went as far as they could.</div>
<div class="line">The lucky ones with their shadows.</div>

  <p><b>Why no comments?</b>
  I used to do public comments but found that moderating and maintaining them took too much time in front of the computer, time better spent playing outdoors.
  So these days I only do private comments, that is, you can email me comments regarding a post by clicking the 'Comment' link at the bottom of the post.
