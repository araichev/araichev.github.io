      <div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving him.</div>
<div class="line">For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.</div>
<div class="line">For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.</div>
<div class="line">For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.</div>
<div class="line">For he rolls upon prank to work it in.</div>
<div class="line">For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.</div>
<div class="line">For this he performs in ten degrees.</div>
<div class="line">For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean.</div>
<div class="line">For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.</div>
<div class="line">For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended.</div>
<div class="line">For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.</div>
<div class="line">For fifthly he washes himself.</div>
<div class="line">For sixthly he rolls upon wash.</div>
<div class="line">For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the beat.</div>
<div class="line">For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.</div>
<div class="line">For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.</div>
<div class="line">For tenthly he goes in quest of food.</div>
<div class="line">For having consider’d God and himself he will consider his neighbour.</div>
<div class="line">For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.</div>
<div class="line">For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance.</div>
<div class="line">For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.</div>
<div class="line">For when his day’s work is done his business more properly begins.</div>
<div class="line">For he keeps the Lord’s watch in the night against the adversary.</div>
<div class="line">For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.</div>
<div class="line">For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.</div>
<div class="line">For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.</div>
<div class="line">For he is of the tribe of Tiger.</div>
<div class="line">For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.</div>
<div class="line">For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses.</div>
<div class="line">For he will not do destruction, if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.</div>
<div class="line">For he purrs in thankfulness, when God tells him he’s a good Cat.</div>
<div class="line">For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.</div>
<div class="line">For every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.</div>
<div class="line">For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt.</div>
<div class="line">For every family had one cat at least in the bag.</div>
<div class="line">For the English Cats are the best in Europe.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped.</div>
<div class="line">For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.</div>
<div class="line">For he is tenacious of his point.</div>
<div class="line">For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.</div>
<div class="line">For he knows that God is his Saviour.</div>
<div class="line">For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.</div>
<div class="line">For there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion.</div>
<div class="line">For he is of the Lord’s poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually—Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.</div>
<div class="line">For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.</div>
<div class="line">For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat.</div>
<div class="line">For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music.</div>
<div class="line">For he is docile and can learn certain things.</div>
<div class="line">For he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation.</div>
<div class="line">For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.</div>
<div class="line">For he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive.</div>
<div class="line">For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.</div>
<div class="line">For he can jump from an eminence into his master’s bosom.</div>
<div class="line">For he can catch the cork and toss it again.</div>
<div class="line">For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.</div>
<div class="line">For the former is afraid of detection.</div>
<div class="line">For the latter refuses the charge.</div>
<div class="line">For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.</div>
<div class="line">For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.</div>
<div class="line">For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.</div>
<div class="line">For he killed the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land.</div>
<div class="line">For his ears are so acute that they sting again.</div>
<div class="line">For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.</div>
<div class="line">For by stroking of him I have found out electricity.</div>
<div class="line">For I perceived God’s light about him both wax and fire.</div>
<div class="line">For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.</div>
<div class="line">For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.</div>
<div class="line">For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.</div>
<div class="line">For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped.</div>
<div class="line">For he can tread to all the measures upon the music.</div>
<div class="line">For he can swim for life.</div>
<div class="line">For he can creep.</div>

      <p>I hereby start a beat log, a collection of danceable rhythms.
Let the first item of the collection be the introduction to 'How You Buy Fire', an Afrobeat-inspired percussion piece i cowrote.

<div class="line">I met a traveller from an antique land</div>
<div class="line">Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</div>
<div class="line">Stand in the desert… Near them, on the sand,</div>
<div class="line">Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</div>

<div class="line">Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</div>
<div class="line">Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</div>
<div class="line">The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.</div>
<div class="line">And on the pedestal these words appear:</div>
<div class="line">&quot;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:</div>
<div class="line">Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</div>
<div class="line">Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare</div>
<div class="line">The lone and level sands stretch far away.</div>

<div class="line">Oh, to love what is lovely, and will not last!</div>
<div class="line">What a task</div>
<div class="line">to ask</div>
<div class="line">of anything, or anyone,</div>
<div class="line">yet it is ours,</div>
<div class="line">and not by the century or the year, but by the hours.</div>
<div class="line">One fall day I heard</div>
<div class="line">above me, and above the sting of the wind, a sound</div>
<div class="line">I did not know, and my look shot upward; it was</div>
<div class="line">a flock of snow geese, winging it</div>
<div class="line">faster than the ones we usually see,</div>
<div class="line">and, being the color of snow, catching the sun</div>
<div class="line">so they were, in part at least, golden. I</div>
<div class="line">held my breath</div>
<div class="line">as we do</div>
<div class="line">sometimes</div>
<div class="line">to stop time</div>
<div class="line">when something wonderful</div>
<div class="line">has touched us</div>
<div class="line">as with a match,</div>
<div class="line">which is lit, and bright,</div>
<div class="line">but does not hurt</div>
<div class="line">in the common way,</div>
<div class="line">but delightfully,</div>
<div class="line">as if delight</div>
<div class="line">were the most serious thing</div>
<div class="line">you ever felt.</div>
<div class="line">The geese</div>
<div class="line">flew on,</div>
<div class="line">I have never seen them again.</div>
<div class="line">Maybe I will, someday, somewhere.</div>
<div class="line">Maybe I won’t.</div>
<div class="line">It doesn’t matter.</div>
<div class="line">What matters</div>
<div class="line">is that, when I saw them,</div>
<div class="line">I saw them</div>
<div class="line">as through the veil, secretly, joyfully, clearly.</div>

<div class="line">Like the others the last one fell into its shadow.</div>
<div class="line">It fell into its shadow on the water.</div>
<div class="line">They took it away its shadow stayed on the water.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Well they shrugged they started trying to get the shadow away.</div>
<div class="line">They cut right to the ground the shadow stayed whole.</div>
<div class="line">They laid boards on it the shadow came out on top.</div>
<div class="line">They shone lights on it the shadow got blacker and clearer.</div>
<div class="line">They exploded the water the shadow rocked.</div>
<div class="line">They built a huge fire on the roots.</div>
<div class="line">They sent up black smoke between the shadow and the sun.</div>
<div class="line">The new shadow flowed without changing the old one.</div>
<div class="line">They shrugged they went away to get stones.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">They came back the shadow was growing.</div>
<div class="line">They started setting up stones it was growing.</div>
<div class="line">They looked the other way it went on growing.</div>
<div class="line">They decided they would make a stone out of it.</div>
<div class="line">They took stones to the water they poured them into the shadow.</div>
<div class="line">They poured them in they poured them in the stones vanished.</div>
<div class="line">The shadow was not filled it went on growing.</div>
<div class="line">That was one day.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The next day was just the same it went on growing.</div>
<div class="line">They did all the same things it was just the same.</div>
<div class="line">They decided to take its water from under it.</div>
<div class="line">They took away water they took it away the water went down.</div>
<div class="line">The shadow stayed where it was before.</div>
<div class="line">It went on growing it grew onto the land.</div>
<div class="line">They started to scrape the shadow with machines.</div>
<div class="line">When it touched the machines it stayed on them.</div>
<div class="line">They started to beat the shadow with sticks.</div>
<div class="line">Where it touched the sticks it stayed on them.</div>
<div class="line">They started to beat the shadow with hands.</div>
<div class="line">Where it touched the hands it stayed on them.</div>
<div class="line">That was another day.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Well the next day started about the same it went on growing.</div>
<div class="line">They pushed lights into the shadow.</div>
<div class="line">Where the shadow got onto them they went out.</div>
<div class="line">They began to stomp on the edge it got their feet.</div>
<div class="line">And when it got their feet they fell down.</div>
<div class="line">It got into eyes the eyes went blind.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The ones that fell down it grew over and they vanished.</div>
<div class="line">The ones that went blind and walked into it vanished.</div>
<div class="line">The ones that could see and stood still</div>
<div class="line">It swallowed their shadows.</div>
<div class="line">Then it swallowed them too and they vanished.</div>
<div class="line">Well the others ran.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The ones that were left went away to live if it would let them.</div>
<div class="line">They went as far as they could.</div>
<div class="line">The lucky ones with their shadows.</div>

  <p><b>Why no comments?</b>
  I used to do public comments but found that moderating and maintaining them took too much time in front of the computer, time better spent playing outdoors.
  So these days I only do private comments, that is, you can email me comments regarding a post by clicking the 'Comment' link at the bottom of the post.
