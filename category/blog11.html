If that sounds useful to you, check out the notes and code on my R&amp;D page.
Extra points if you review the Sage patch :-)</p>

      <h1><a href="https://raichev.net/7-rules-for-communicating-clearly-and-concisely-in-email.html">7 Rules for Communicating Clearly and Concisely in Email</a></h1>
      <p>Written by Leo Babauta 2007-10-05</p>
<p>As email is the prevalent form of communication for many web workers, it’s gotten a lot of attention: how to handle your email, how to empty your inbox, email etiquette, and more.</p>
<p>But perhaps not enough time is spent learning about how to communicate with email. And more specifically, how to communicate clearly and concisely, two crucial aspects of communication that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>How many times have you received a rambling and incoherent email? How many times have you hit “Delete” because you have no idea what the person wants and no time to sort through the long message?</p>
<p>The truth is that people don’t have time for long emails, and they don’t have time to try to find out exactly what you want. You have to tell them, in as short an email as possible.</p>
<p>Misunderstandings are also a problem, because of the nature of email. People are often ambiguous, and their messages are interpreted differently than they intended, leading to a waste of time and energy.</p>
<p>Communicate clearly and concisely with the following rules.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Use the minimum amount of sentences. I’ve been using the 5-sentence rule, but you can use more if needed. The question is: how many sentences are needed to communicate what you’re trying to communicate? Or how few sentences can you get away with. Cut it to that number, and no more. That ensures that you’re not wasting the time of the recipient, and that your email actually gets read (people tend to put off reading longer ones, and might even delete them).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State what you want right away. Don’t write a long introduction, telling your life story, or any story for that matter. People aren’t interested. They just want to know what you want. So state that, in the first sentence. Skip the niceties. Don’t make the recipient wade through 10 paragraphs to find what action is needed for the email.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Write about only one thing. There have been numerous times when I read an email, saw the action needed, and went and did it … only to find out that three other things were also needed to respond to the email. I’ve also responded to the first part of an email and not to others, just because I didn’t have enough time.</p>
<p>If you write about multiple things, with multiple requests, you do two things: 1) make it likely that your email actually won’t be read or acted on; and 2) make it likely that even if it is acted on or responded to, the recipient will only do one of those things.</p>
<p>Instead, stick to one subject, with one request. Once that’s done, you can send a second one, but don’t overwhelm the recipient if at all possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Leave out the humor and emotions. These don’t come across well in an email. Even if you use emoticons. There’s just no way to express tone, inflection, etc. … and there’s no way to know if the recipient understands that you’re joking. If you’re communicating in person, you can see that the person didn’t understand the humor, and say, “I was only joking!” But not in email.</p>
<p>So, unless you know the person well, and you know they’ll understand that you’re joking, leave out humor. It’s a risk that you don’t want to take.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use “If... then” statements. As email is a back-and-forth method of communicating, and it can take a day or more for a response (in some cases), you want to limit the number of times a message has to go back and forth. To do that, use “if … then” statements, anticipating the possible responses to your question.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to know if a person has received a response to an inquiry, instead of asking if they’ve received a response, and then waiting for a reply, and then sending another email based on that reply, try doing it all in one email:</p>
<p>“Have you received a response from Mr. X yet? If so, please finish the report by Tuesday and email it to me. If not, can you follow up today and let me know the response?”</p>
<p>By anticipating the possible responses, and giving a desired action for each possible response, you’re cutting a lot of wasted back-and-forth time.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Review for ambiguity, clarity. Once you’ve written an email, take a few seconds to read over it before pressing the Send button. Read it as if you were an outsider — how clear it it? Are there any ambiguous statements that could be interpreted the wrong way? If so, clarify.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Revise for conciseness. As you review, also see if there is a way you can shorten the email, remove words or sentences or even paragraphs. Leave nothing but the essential message you’re trying to communicate.</p>
</li>
</ol>

      <div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving him.</div>
<div class="line">For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.</div>
<div class="line">For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.</div>
<div class="line">For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.</div>
<div class="line">For he rolls upon prank to work it in.</div>
<div class="line">For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.</div>
<div class="line">For this he performs in ten degrees.</div>
<div class="line">For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean.</div>
<div class="line">For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.</div>
<div class="line">For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended.</div>
<div class="line">For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.</div>
<div class="line">For fifthly he washes himself.</div>
<div class="line">For sixthly he rolls upon wash.</div>
<div class="line">For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the beat.</div>
<div class="line">For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.</div>
<div class="line">For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.</div>
<div class="line">For tenthly he goes in quest of food.</div>
<div class="line">For having consider’d God and himself he will consider his neighbour.</div>
<div class="line">For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.</div>
<div class="line">For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance.</div>
<div class="line">For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.</div>
<div class="line">For when his day’s work is done his business more properly begins.</div>
<div class="line">For he keeps the Lord’s watch in the night against the adversary.</div>
<div class="line">For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.</div>
<div class="line">For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.</div>
<div class="line">For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.</div>
<div class="line">For he is of the tribe of Tiger.</div>
<div class="line">For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.</div>
<div class="line">For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses.</div>
<div class="line">For he will not do destruction, if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.</div>
<div class="line">For he purrs in thankfulness, when God tells him he’s a good Cat.</div>
<div class="line">For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.</div>
<div class="line">For every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.</div>
<div class="line">For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt.</div>
<div class="line">For every family had one cat at least in the bag.</div>
<div class="line">For the English Cats are the best in Europe.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped.</div>
<div class="line">For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.</div>
<div class="line">For he is tenacious of his point.</div>
<div class="line">For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.</div>
<div class="line">For he knows that God is his Saviour.</div>
<div class="line">For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.</div>
<div class="line">For there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion.</div>
<div class="line">For he is of the Lord’s poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually—Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.</div>
<div class="line">For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.</div>
<div class="line">For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat.</div>
<div class="line">For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music.</div>
<div class="line">For he is docile and can learn certain things.</div>
<div class="line">For he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation.</div>
<div class="line">For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.</div>
<div class="line">For he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive.</div>
<div class="line">For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.</div>
<div class="line">For he can jump from an eminence into his master’s bosom.</div>
<div class="line">For he can catch the cork and toss it again.</div>
<div class="line">For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.</div>
<div class="line">For the former is afraid of detection.</div>
<div class="line">For the latter refuses the charge.</div>
<div class="line">For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.</div>
<div class="line">For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.</div>
<div class="line">For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.</div>
<div class="line">For he killed the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land.</div>
<div class="line">For his ears are so acute that they sting again.</div>
<div class="line">For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.</div>
<div class="line">For by stroking of him I have found out electricity.</div>
<div class="line">For I perceived God’s light about him both wax and fire.</div>
<div class="line">For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.</div>
<div class="line">For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.</div>
<div class="line">For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.</div>
<div class="line">For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped.</div>
<div class="line">For he can tread to all the measures upon the music.</div>
<div class="line">For he can swim for life.</div>
<div class="line">For he can creep.</div>

  <p><b>Why no comments?</b>
  I used to do public comments but found that moderating and maintaining them took too much time in front of the computer, time better spent playing outdoors.
  So these days I only do private comments, that is, you can email me comments regarding a post by clicking the 'Comment' link at the bottom of the post.
