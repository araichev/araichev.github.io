Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
      F
Makes babies to breathe 
                                   C
With their hearts hanging open all over the sheets
                                       F
As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer 
         C 
And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing
        F
They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating 
     C
Till wonderfully wet she will get 
                              F
Until she's soaked inside her clothes
                                  E 
And there is no sorry to be sorry for
                      F                                 E
For a roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft
                            F
It made her swallow all her sweat 
                             E
With every bit of breath she coughs
                            F    
And when the day it came to pour all her babies
                        G
All across the bathroom floor
                                         C      F
She will be swimming in them all forever more

Glow right into you I will  (twice)
C               F                 E
Glow right into you and I let you down
            F                             E
Swollen and small is where you'll find me now
                           F                              E
With that silver stripping off and my tongue your tearing out
                         F  G
And you'll never here me talk

----------------------------------------
C               F
Glow right into you I will  (twice)
C               F                 E
Glow right into you and I will be strong
                 F                                     E 
Strong enough to shout above your voice that's blaring on
                              F                             E
With your face that's falling out into the dust of what you are
                        F  G    C      F 
And I'll never here you taaa... aaa... aaa... lk

Glow right into you I will  (twice)
C               F       E
Glow right into yooo... ou 
                   F       E 
And with my little finger
                    F        E
I could make it all  crumble
                    F     E
I could make it all  over
       F          G 
Before you would even know
C
Glow
