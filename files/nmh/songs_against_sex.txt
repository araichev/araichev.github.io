Bb

        Bb
And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man 
Who was kissing foreign fishes 
That flew right out from this hands
           F
And when I put my arms around him
I felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
       Bb
And an eeriness surrounded when his tongue began to speak
                 F
And he said, "Oh boy you are so pretty
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string..." 
    Bb 
And when I finally kissed him the whole world began to ring
            F
Lost like a bell that's tipping over 
With two cracks along both sides 
      Bb
And I knew the world was over so I took a look outside
                F
And watched the fires that were reaching 
Up to the weather vane and the tops of trees 
        Bb
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream
                                 F   Bb
They're all waiting here for me

----------------------------------------
     Bb
Deli markets with their flower stands
And pretty girls and the burning men 
        F
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue twice removed from my face 
         Bb
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in a fountain 
           F
To save my soul from all these troubled times 
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take 
                                Bb
To soothe my mind so I'm always sober
Always aching, always heading towards 
        F
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendents
Attending to their jobs
      Bb 
And a nice drive in the country 
Finds a nice cliff to drop off 
             F 
Oh when this life just gets so grating 
All the grittiness of life
          Bb
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you
                             F   Bb   F   Bb
You're too wonderful to die

----------------------------------------
        Bb
And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
But all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
           F
And it's a lie that you've been given
It just hurts you every day
       Bb
So why should i lay here naked
When it's just too far away
        F
From anything we could call loving
Any love worth living for
        Bb
So I'll sleep out in the gutter 
You can sleep here on the floor
           F
And when I wake up in the morning 
I won't forget to lock the door
              Bb  
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
                           F   Bb
You won't see me anymore
