C
All I perceive is wasted and broken
F
Silvery streams, sacred when spoken
C                                  F
Slam into me and into the ditch of debris
        C                   
And you smoke in the park you sleep in the greenery
F
Everyone barks and all still believing 
   C                                                  F
To tear out your heart would send all your secrets to me

----------------------------------------
              E
But I let you down
                F                             E
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
                           F
With that silver stripping off 
                              E
From my tongue you're tearing out
                         F  G
And you'll never hear me talk 

----------------------------------------
     C
Your teeth believe that teeth are for tearing
F                                          C
Tear into me and the scent of you sweating smells good to me
                          F
As long as we keep in our clothes
    C
And out in the dark the world is still rolling
F
Kids in their cars, cigarette smoking
    C                                                F 
And all that they are just reeks with the sweetest belief

----------------------------------------
              E
But I let you down
                F                             E 
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
                           F
With that silver stripping off 
                              E   
From my tongue you're tearing out
                         F  G
And you'll never hear me talk 

C   F   C   F

----------------------------------------
    C
And all I could want is silver and spinning 
F                                      C 
Out from your arms and into the pretty pit of your heart
                          F
So simply and softly we'd flow

----------------------------------------
              E
But I let you down
                F                             E  
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
                           F
With that silver stripping off 
                              E 
From my tongue you're tearing out
                         F  G
And you'll never hear me talk

     F

           C
And I will glow
     F              C
Into youuuuuuuuuuuuuu
