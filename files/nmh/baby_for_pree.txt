Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
      F
Makes babies to breathe 
                                   C
With their hearts hanging open all over the sheets
                                       F
As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer 
         C 
And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing
        F
They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating 
     C
Till wonderfully wet she will get 
                              F
Until she's soaked inside her clothes
                                  E 
And there is no sorry to be sorry for
                      F                                 E
For a roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft
                            F
It made her swallow all her sweat 
                             E
With every bit of breath she coughs
                            F    
And when the day it came to pour all her babies
                        G
All across the bathroom floor
                                         C
She will be swimming in them all forever more
