G
Oh sister, don't be afraid of me
I won't be nailing you down in the nursery
C
Just like the rest of them did with those watery 
Wandering fingers that slipped that were supposed to be
G                  C* G 
Glorious and fine
Oh sister, won't you believe in me
I only wanted to be hard on the family
C
Here with you now in this silly infirmary
Your mother makes frantic and drunk calls from Germany
G           C* G
All of the time
Oh sister, sweet brown and beulahry
Milk from your blisters on your grandmother's jewelry
C
There in the parlor all naked in front of me
Watching the lights from the cracks making archery 
G         C* G
Animal designs

----------------------------------------
Em                          
Rose Wallace Goldeline just 
C
Moves her mouth over anything that's
G                              D
Fleshy free and flowering like oranges out in the open
    Em                                    
But don't you waste your sins again
    C
You don't need you or won't fuck your friends
    G                            D
And you, you're American, self important boiling over
   Em                                  
To prove that she must still exist 
    C
She moves herself about her fist
    G                                  D                              
And won't ever never give a shit about all those words you're wasting
Em                   
   Again some pretty 
C   
   Bright and bubbly 
G                            D
Wondrous dream you'd like to kill and cling and claim her as your 
Em                       
Own, but don't you worry   
C
   All those dainty and dirty
G                D                             G  
   Emotions just go away and fade out on their own

----------------------------------------
G
Sister, now that you're leaving
Our fingers will falter, our lungs will be leaking
    C 
All over each other and without even speaking
We'll know that it's over and smiling or greeting
G               C* G
Whatever comes next
And oh sister, you're getting married 
With some angry twister that you'll have to carry home 
C
Drunk every evening from the cemetery
And if he makes it back half alive you can bury him
G            C* G 
Under your sheets
And oh sister, now that you're grieving
I can not imagine there is any meaning
   C
Forgetting you ever could once had the feeling that made you keep on
And pretend you were breathing  
   G            C* G 
Of all of this world
                   D
And in an age of empty rings
                         C
I don't want to feel a thing
                     G    C* G
I don't even want to know
                  D
Rose Wallace Goldeline
                      C
Don't you ever die on me
                          G     G
Don't you own the way you go
