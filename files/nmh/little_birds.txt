Am
Little birds born without a mother or a father
Am
I can feel their feathers forming in the running water
G
Now there is another in the middle of my mouth
Em
A hundred altogether inside of me now
Am
Little birds, little birds come into my body
----------------------------------------
Am
Mother, they're within me every moment I'm awaking
Am
Bodies multiplying 'til they finally overtake me
G
Put your ears up to my mouth and you can hear them singing
Em
Put you hands within me and you'll know what I am feeling
Am
I just want to swallow up and promise to protect them
----------------------------------------
Am
Daddy come towards me I can see his hands are shaking
Am
Put his hands against me he can feel their bodies breaking
G
Push me to the floor and put his hands up for a beating
Em
"I don't want to hear it anymore" he kept repeating
Am
"Do you really want the burning hell to come and get you?"
F
Ah...
Am

----------------------------------------
Am
"Did you see the burning hell it took your baby brother?
Am
"Did you see how far he fell and how he made us suffer?
G
"Another boy in town at night he took him for his lover
    Em
"And deep in sin they held each other
Am
"So I took a hammer and nearly beat his little brains in
Am
"Knowing God in heaven no could never could forgive him
Am                                         G   Em
"So I took a hammer nearly beat his brains in"
----------------------------------------
Am
Little boy born without a mother or a father
Am
Taken to the river and then pushed into the water
G                                                         Em
And the priest is singing that the hell is getting hotter la la la la la
Am
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the only ones to save him
Am
From the thing he loves the most but we know will betray him
Am                                                 G    Em
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the only ones to save him
----------------------------------------
Am                   G
And here beneath the water I can see
        Em                Am
How the light distorts so strange
                  G                        Em            
And this is how I   would like to leave my   body
           Am
And start again
