C                         G
  The only girl I've ever   loved
C                            G
  Was born with roses in her   eyes
C                           G
  But then they buried her alive 
            D  C
One evening 1945
              D             G  
With just her sister at her side 
         D                C   
And only weeks before the guns 
             D              G
All came and rained on everyone 
            D             C
Now she's a little boy in Spain 
          D                G
Playing pianos filled with flames
         D                C
On empty rings around the sun
            D              C      G    
All sing to say my dream has come

----------------------------------------
                C             G
But now we must pick up every piece
       C               G
Of the life we used to love 
        C 
Just to keep ourselves
   G                     D
At least enough to carry   on

---------------------------------------- 
C                        G 
  And now we ride the circus wheel
C                                G
  With your dark brother wrapped in white
C                         G
  Says it was good to be alive
           D               C  
But now he rides a comet's flame 
             D            G
And won't be coming back again
                D             C
The Earth looks better from a star
              D                   G 
That's right above from where you are 
          D                C
He didn't mean to make you cry 
                 D                G
With sparks that ring and bullets fly 
         D                 C
On empty rings around your heart
               D                 C       G
The world just screams and falls   apart 
---------------------------------------- 
                C             G
But now we must pick up every piece
       C               G
Of the life we used to love
        C     
Just to keep ourselves
   G                     D
At least enough to carry   on
----------------------------------------
    G      A     C    C      G  
And here's where your mother sleeps
    G    A  C   C               G             D 
And here is the room where your brothers were born
G A        C      G    
Indentions in the sheets 
            G A    C    C               G       D 
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
            C      G       C     G     
And it's so sad to see the world agree 
            C                G               D
That they'd rather see their faces fill with flies
G   A    C   C       G          D              G
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes

C   G   C   D   C   G
