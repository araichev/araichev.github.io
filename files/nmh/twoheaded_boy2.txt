Daddy please hear this song that I sing
G#                      F#              Fm
In your heart there's a spark that just screams
      C#               G#            D#               C#
For a lover to bring a child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
         G#           D#             C#
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
     A#m                            D#
Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet

Love to be with a brother of mine
         C#                G#            D#
How he'd love to find your tongue in his teeth
     C#                      G#             D#              C#
In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
         A#m                  D#
Sounding only at night as you sleep 

----------------------------------------
G#         A#m            D#             C# G#
And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
        A#m            D#            C# G#
As your mouth moves in mine soft and sweet
         A#m                 D#         C#   G#
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I love you
         A#m         D#    C#  A#m  D#
For the rest of your life  ???????????

Brother see we are one in the same
G#                     F#               Fm
And you left with your head filled with flames
        C#                     G#                    D#
And you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth
         C#
Push the pieces in place 
          G#             D#
Make your smile sweet to see 
          C# 
Don't you take this away 
          A#m                     D#
I'm still wanting my face on your cheek

----------------------------------------
    C#      G#          C#           G#
And when we break we'll wait for our miracle
C#       G#          D#                  C#
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies 
    C#      G#          C#           G#
And when we break we'll wait for our miracle
C#       G#             D#                        C#
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life

Two headed boy, she is all you could need
         G#          C         C#    G#
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
    C#                        D#         
And retire to sheets safe and clean
          C#                              G#
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
