There are beads that wrap 

Around your knees that crackle into the dark
       F#
Like a walk in the park like a hole in your head 
                                                 B     
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead

This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
                                F#
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world 

And I guess it's worth your time

Because there's some lives you live 
                     E     
And some you leave behind
                  B
It gets hard to explain

The gardenhead knows my name

----------------------------------------
          B                                 E
Leave me alone, for you know this isn't the first time
                           B            
In fact this is twice in a row 
                                         E
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
                              B     
And filled up our garden with snow
                                  E
And I don't wish to taste of your insides 
                                    B      
Or to call out your name through my phone
                           E          
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
                            B      E               
As long as you're something to own   (twice)

----------------------------------------
          B                               E     
Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
                          B     
I swear I have nothing to prove 
                             E
I just want to dance in your tangles
                          B
To give me some reason to move 
                                E
But to take on the world at all angles
                            B 
Requires a strength I can't use
                                 E     
So I'll meet you up high in your anger 
                                  B       E          
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you   (twice)
B
