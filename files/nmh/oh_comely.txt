Oh comely
                                      E
I will be with you when you lose your breath
                 C                                       E
Chasing the only   meaningful memory you thought you had left
                                   C
With some pretty bright and bubbly terrible scene
                                 E
That was doing her thing on your chest
              C
But oh comely 
                                    G
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
In your memory 
You're drunk on your awe to me
   C                            E
It doesn't mean anything at all
          C
Oh comely
                                    E
All of your friends are letting you blow
                   C
Bristling and ugly
                                          E
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
                                 C
Of some pretty bright and bubbly friend 
                                                E
You could need to say comforting things in your ear
              C
But oh comely 
                                                G
There isn't such one friend that you could find here
Standing next to me
He's only my enemy 
     C 
I'll crush him with everything I own
E
Say what you want to say and hang for your hollow ways. 
G                                              E   
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracle ?eh 
    C       D G D G D G D E     
For me...

E
Your father made fetuses 
With flesh licking ladies 
      C
While you and your mother 
Were asleep in the trailer park
E
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
    C
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
   E
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
    C
And pluck all your silly strings 
And bend all your notes for me
    E
And soft silly music is meaningful magical
    C 
The movements were beautiful
All in your ovaries
E
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
      C
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
E
Smelling of semen all under the garden
    C 
Was all you were needing when you still believed in me
E
Say what you want to say and hang for your hollow ways
G                                              E    
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracle ?eh 
    C       D G D G D G D E     
For me...

E
I know they buried her body with others 
    C
Her sister and mother and 500 families.
    E    
And will she remember me 50 years later
  C  
I wished i could save her in some sort of time machine.
E
Know all your enemies 
   C
We know who are enemies are
E
Know all your enemies
   C
We know who our enemies are

Am
Goldaline my dear 
We will fold and freeze together
E
Far away from here 
There is sun and spring and green forever 
    Am
But now we move to feel
For ourselves inside some stranger's stomach
E
Place your body here 
                                         Am
Let your skin begin to blend itself with mine  
Ahah ah ah ahah ah
