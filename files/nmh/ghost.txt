Ghost, ghost I know you live within me, 
feel as you fly
In thunder clouds above the city, 
into one that I
A
Love with all that was left within me 
until we tore in two
E
Now wings and rings and there's so many 
                    B  A  E
waiting there for you

And she was born in a bottle rocket in 1929
With wings that ring around the socket 
right betwen her spine
A
All drenched in milk and holy water 
pouring from the sky

E
I know that she will live forever, 
she won't ever die
B
And she goes, 
                                   E
and now she knows she'll never be afraid
   B   
So watch the morning paper blow 
                              A   E       
into a hole where no one can escape

And one day in New York city baby, 
a girl fell from the sky
From the top of a burning apartment building, 
fourteen stories high
    A
And when her spirit left her body 
how it split the sun
E
I know that she will live forever 
all goes on and on and on and 
B
She goes 
                                   E
and now she knows she'll never be afraid
B        
Watch the morning paper blow 
                              A  
into a hole where no one can escape
